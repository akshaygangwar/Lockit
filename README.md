# README.md - Lockit

### What is Lockit ###
Lockit is an android app that provides a method to lock your phone without using the hardware power button on your device.  
If, like me, you have an Android device that has seen a fair share of wear and tear (that's too many rhyming words!), chances are it too has a problem with the power button. That's annoying.  
Now there are quite a lot of apps that accomplish this very task, and some that are quite a bit smaller in size than Lockit, but I coded this out for a couple of reasons:


* Since I coded it myself, I learnt a truck-load of new stuff. 
* I know exactly what the app does, and how; meaning I can give admin privileges to the app without worrying about any unwanted activities that an app developed by someone else might do.
